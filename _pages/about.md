Hi, I'm Jay Chaudhary, a 4th-year student at IIT Bombay majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Machine Learning and Data Science. I am passionate about Machine Learning and deeply intrigued by Probability and Statistics. I am particularly interested in the fields of Computer Vision, Explainable ML, and Reinforcement Learning.

I have worked on diverse research projects, including semi-supervised object detection with CAGE pseudo-labeling, which leveraged CNN models to enhance Faster R-CNN’s performance, and 3D reconstruction of the oral cavity, focusing on adapting NVIDIA’s Instant-NGP NeRF for medical applications. My other projects span generative AI and computer vision.

During my internship at A*STAR, I contributed to multi-property molecular optimization using Explainable AI, developing an innovative architecture that integrated GNNShap for ante-hoc interpretability and proposing new molecular constraints for stabilized training. At Atomberg Technologies, I optimized YOLO and ViT for fan detection and classification, achieving high detection accuracy and robust real-time performance.

Beyond academics and research, I love challenging myself with brain teasers and coding problems. I love to play football, volleyball, and other video games.
