## Research Projects
### Semi-Supervised Object Detection with CAGE Pseudo-Labeling
Research project with [Prof. Ganesh Ramkrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/)
Object detection models heavily rely on large, labeled datasets, which are often expensive and time-consuming to create. This dependence limits their scalability and effectiveness, particularly in domains where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. Without sufficient labeled data, these models struggle to achieve the accuracy and generalizability needed for real-world applications.

To address the reliance on labeled data, our project employs a semi-supervised learning framework using CAGE (Continuous and Quality-Guided Labeling Functions) and pseudo-labeling techniques. CAGE integrates predictions from multiple deep learning models, such as ResNet and VGG-16, to generate robust and accurate pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels allow us to train object detection frameworks like Faster R-CNN on unlabeled data. By leveraging joint learning, we optimize the pseudo-labeling process and the detection model simultaneously. This approach enhances scalability, improves accuracy, and enables effective object detection in scenarios where labeled datasets are scarce or unavailable.
