## Research Projects
### Semi-Supervised Object Detection with CAGE Pseudo-Labeling
Research project with [Prof. Ganesh Ramkrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/)

Object detection models heavily rely on large, labeled datasets, which are often expensive and time-consuming to create. This dependence limits their scalability and effectiveness, particularly in domains where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. Without sufficient labeled data, these models struggle to achieve the accuracy and generalizability needed for real-world applications.

To address the reliance on labeled data, our project employs a semi-supervised learning framework using CAGE (Continuous and Quality-Guided Labeling Functions) and pseudo-labeling techniques. CAGE integrates predictions from multiple deep learning models, such as ResNet and VGG-16, to generate robust and accurate pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels allow us to train object detection frameworks like Faster R-CNN on unlabeled data. By leveraging joint learning, we optimize the pseudo-labeling process and the detection model simultaneously. This approach enhances scalability, improves accuracy, and enables effective object detection in scenarios where labeled datasets are scarce or unavailable.

### Threshold-Based Optimal Arm Selection in Structured Bandit Problems
B.Tech thesis project with [Prof. Prasanna Chaporkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/prasanna-chaporkar/)

In communication systems, ensuring efficient resource allocation while maintaining performance is a critical challenge. The problem lies in determining the optimal amount of resources required to guarantee that the average loss remains below a specified threshold. Striking this balance is essential to optimize system performance without over-provisioning.

To address the resource allocation challenge, we model the problem as a multi-armed bandit framework, where each CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) value (0-15) represents an arm. We designed an algorithm to identify the optimal armâ€”the one that achieves an average loss just below the specified threshold. Additionally, we are working on proving the optimality of the algorithm.

### 3D Reconstruction of Oral Cavity from Intraoral Camera Images
I am currently working with [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on developing a system for 3D reconstruction of intraoral videos for medical applications. The project aims to create detailed 3D models of the oral cavity from video data captured during examinations. By addressing challenges such as motion artifacts and lighting variations, we strive to enable accurate reconstructions that can enhance diagnostics and treatment planning in dentistry and oral healthcare.
